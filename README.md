# CMIP5 Metadata .csv Cleanup and Deduplication

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook to cleanup and deduplicate the metadata generated using the csvgen tool in the cltools repository.

The additional .csv files (dimensions and variables) were generated from a previous iteration of the main climatedata .csv

The dedup.py script can be ran from the terminal on the climatedata system to generate a new .csv file.
